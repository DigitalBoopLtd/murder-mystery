"""Core game domain package for the murder mystery."""

# This package will eventually contain:
# - Turn/action logic (e.g. `actions`, `handlers`)
# - State & state management (`state`, `state_manager`)
# - Media helpers that are tightly coupled to game rules
# - Mystery generation and domain models
